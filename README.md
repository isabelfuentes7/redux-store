## Your Task

In this unit, you learned how to manage global state using React’s Context API. The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. Nonetheless, the open source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application, and you’ll likely encounter it on the job.

Your challenge this week is to refactor the e-commerce platform from [Activity 26](../01-Activities/26-Stu_Actions-Reducers/Unsolved) so that it uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). You won’t need to make sweeping changes to the code, but you will need to read through the Redux documentation on your own to find the information you need. Some guidelines have been provided in the Getting Started section to point you in the right direction. If you haven't yet, download the [e-commerce platform code from Activity 26](http://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/fullstack-ground/unit-22/26-Stu_Actions-Reducers.zip).

**On the Job**: Web developers frequently have to immerse themselves in a new technology to solve a problem, with only that tool’s documentation for help. They must sift through it to find the information that matches the specific problem they’re trying to solve. This assignment will allow you to practice a skill that you’ll use many times over the course of your career.

## User Story

```md
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the app’s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
